  "dialogue.main.night/5": "Sure, the guards are on patrol, but it's still creepy out. You're not scared?",
  "dialogue.main.night/6": "Finally, some quiet. Nighttime's the only break I get from all the noise.",
  "dialogue.main.night/7": "The day's too crowded. Night's the only time for a decent walk without bumping into everyone.",
  "dialogue.main.night/8": "Can barely keep my eyes open. Bet I'll be dragging myself around tomorrow.",
  "dialogue.main.night/9": "Me and my bed are about to have a serious meeting.",

  "dialogue.location.forgot/2": "You're after intriguing spots? Sure, there was... oh, blast it! Slip of the mind. Didn't pen it anywhere, apologies.",
  "dialogue.location.forgot/3": "There was definitely something worth mentioning, but it slipped my mind! Regrettable, indeed.",
  "dialogue.location.igloo/1": "Stumbled upon a freezing igloo at %2$s. Insane, living in a home of frost. Chills me to the bone just thinking about it!",

  "dialogue.location.mansion/2": "That monstrosity of a mansion squatting at %2$s? Yeah, it's crawling with illagers. Honestly, packing up the village and hightailing it to the other side of nowhere sounds about right…",

  "dialogue.location.jungle_pyramid/2": "Stumble into %2$s and you'll find a heap of old stones they call ruins. Tread lightly, or those cursed traps will be the end of you. We would've picked the place clean ourselves if they weren't.",
  "dialogue.location.pillager_outpost/1": "Grumble all you want, but those no-good Pillagers have plopped their nasty outpost at %2$s. Bet they're scheming an attack on us as we speak. We'd crumble like a stale cookie under their boots.",

  "dialogue.location.pillager_outpost/3": "So, you fancy a stroll to %2$s, huh? That's where those pillaging pests have their lair. Knock the snot out of them, and you might snag some treasures. Honestly, it'd be a relief to have them gone.",

  "dialogue.joke.animal.failed/4": "That's just tasteless.",
  "dialogue.joke.animal.failed/5": "Lay off the cow's eyebrows, it's not amusing.",

  "dialogue.flirt.slap/1": "Watch it, buster!",
  "dialogue.flirt.slap/2": "What, you learn romance from a Creeper?",
  "dialogue.kiss.slap/1": "The nerve of some people!",
  "dialogue.kiss.slap/2": "Do that once more and you'll regret it, I swear on my carrots!",

  "dialogue.chat.plains/1": "The plains? Meh, they're alright, I guess. Haven't bothered with anywhere else. Might drag myself out eventually...",
  "dialogue.chat.plains/2": "Sure, it's quiet on the plains. Not that I'd enjoy the racket elsewhere, but a little excitement wouldn't kill me.",
  "dialogue.chat.plains/3": "Occasionally, the plains at night aren't too terrible to gaze upon... if you're into that sort of thing.",
  "dialogue.chat.plains/4": "Sometimes, I just flop down and stare up, if only to avoid talking to anyone.",
  "dialogue.chat.plains/5": "Yeah, the air's fresh. Beats the taiga, not that I'm one for fresh air or anything.",
  "dialogue.chat.plains/6": "Plains are plain, but I suppose there's something to be said for mundane consistency.",
  "dialogue.chat.plains/7": "Used to pick wild flowers when I was a young'un. Gave 'em to Ash, not that they cared much.",
  "dialogue.chat.plains/8": "Sunrise, huh? It's alright here in the plains, if you're the type that likes waking up early.",
  "dialogue.chat.savanna/1": "Sweltering heat every day in this savanna, and no winter to break the monotony.",
  "dialogue.chat.savanna/2": "Can't walk two steps without a llama in the way, but this place grows on you, I guess.",
  "dialogue.chat.savanna/3": "At least the buildings around here have some character. It's the only thing keeping me from leaving.",
  "dialogue.chat.savanna/4": "You might not think much of the savanna, but there's more to it than meets the eye.",
  "dialogue.chat.savanna/5": "We may not get much rain, but at least we're not gasping for water like those desert villages.",
  "dialogue.chat.savanna/6": "These rolling hills might be the only pleasing thing to look at around here.",
  "dialogue.chat.savanna/7": "Thank goodness for the acacia's shade, or I'd never make it through these endless workdays.",
  "dialogue.chat.savanna/8": "If there's one thing we do right in this savanna, it's growing melons and pumpkins. They're our ticket to dealing with outsiders.",
  "dialogue.chat.taiga/1": "The woods are alright, I suppose. They give me what I need to build and burn, plus there's game to hunt.",
  "dialogue.chat.taiga/2": "They say it's too chilly in the taiga, but we've got our necessities. I'm not trading it for some sunny paradise.",
  "dialogue.chat.taiga/3": "Taiga forests? They're bearable. The berries are the one good thing about this place.",
  "dialogue.chat.taiga/4": "The foxes here are the least annoying things in the taiga. I toss them berries just to keep them off my back.",
  "dialogue.chat.taiga/5": "With all the food crawling around, the wolves aren't much of a bother, thankfully.",
  "dialogue.chat.taiga/6": "The taiga air is fresh, yeah. It's a small comfort in this frozen wasteland.",
  "dialogue.chat.taiga/7": "Those sweet berry bushes might be good for something, but they prick you if you're not careful. Annoying little things.",
  "dialogue.chat.taiga/8": "Sure, the rain here can be soothing, but it's as cold as the rest of this place",
  "dialogue.chat.snowy_plains/1": "This place could freeze the horns off a goat, but with enough logs for a fire, I can't complain too much.",
  "dialogue.chat.snowy_plains/2": "It's colder than a polar bear's nose out here, but hey, the fish aren't going anywhere. Hmph!",
  "dialogue.chat.snowy_plains/3": "Only good thing about this icy hell is I can wrap up in a blanket and read by the fire without sweating like a pig.",
  "dialogue.chat.snowy_plains/4": "Snow brings back memories of being a runt, throwing snowballs with the other brats. Not that I'd care to do it again.",
  "dialogue.chat.snowy_plains/5": "Nights are a nightmare here, what with strays prowling about, flinging those blasted arrows!",
  "dialogue.chat.snowy_plains/6": "Watch it with the wolves lurking about, not that the guards are much use.",
  "dialogue.chat.snowy_plains/7": "Touch an iron golem, and you might as well kiss your day goodbye, stuck in one spot like a statue.",
  "dialogue.chat.snowy_plains/8": "Back when I was knee-high, getting a pumpkin was a big deal. We'd make snow",
  "dialogue.chat.desert/1": "This blazing heat is relentless, but I suppose it beats shivering through winter.",
  "dialogue.chat.desert/2": "Blisteringly hot every single day, without fail.",
  "dialogue.chat.desert/3": "Sure, it's scorching, but look on the bright side, I've got a permanent burn to prove I'm alive!",
  "dialogue.chat.desert/4": "The nights may be bearable with a cool breeze and a sky full of stars, but don't expect me to be cheery about it.",
  "dialogue.chat.desert/5": "Ugh! I'm actually missing the shade today, and that says a lot.",
  "dialogue.chat.desert/6": "Ugh! The sun's a real tyrant today!",
  "dialogue.chat.desert/7": "You spotting any rabbits is a miracle with this blinding sand!",
  "dialogue.chat.desert/8": "Living with husks is a nightmare. They pack a punch that turns your stomach inside out, the nuisances.",
  "dialogue.chat.desert/9": "Stumbled into a cactus again. This place is a minefield!",
  "dialogue.chat.desert/10": "Surviving in this arid wasteland is a daily battle, but thankfully, we",

  "dialogue.story.exploring.success/1": "Hmph, maybe I'll wander off too, if I ever get a break from this place.",
  "dialogue.story.exploring.success/2": "Great, another wanderer's tales. Must be nice, while I'm stuck here with the same old faces.",
  "dialogue.story.exploring.success/3": "Brave or just plain foolish, I guess you've got guts to trek into the unknown.",
  "dialogue.story.exploring.fail/1": "Heard it all before, spare me the repeat.",
  "dialogue.story.exploring.fail/2": "Careful now, wouldn’t want you to nick yourself on all that grit.",
  "dialogue.story.exploring.fai/l3": "Chatting with you is like enduring a toddler’s rambling about their future dreams, minus the charm.",

  "dialogue.story.nether.success/1": "Blazes, is it always that scorching in the Nether, or what?!",
  "dialogue.story.nether.success/2": "Hmph, I'm surprised you made it back from that deathtrap. Guess you're tougher than you look.",
  "dialogue.story.nether.success/3": "They say there's a fortune to be had in the Nether for the daring... Not that I'd bother with such a fool's errand.",
  "dialogue.story.nether.success/4": "So you fancy yourself a hero for trotting into the Nether, huh? Does it ever spook you, or are you just daft? I'd be... sensible, that's all.",
  "dialogue.story.nether.success/5": "Ever stumble across one of those rotten Zombified Piglins?",
  "dialogue.story.nether.fail/1": "Pfft, you wouldn't last a minute in the Nether, would you?",
  "dialogue.story.nether.fail/2": "No wonder those Piglins chased you out. You probably looked as lost as a sheep in a desert.",
  "dialogue.story.nether.fail/3": "Spare me your Nether tales, they're as dull as dirt.",
  "dialogue.story.nether.fail/4": "The Nether, really? You couldn't swing a pickaxe without a creeper going boo!",
  "dialogue.story.nether.fail/5": "Grandpa was a Nether veteran, and what's this nonsense about warped fungus? Pull the other one!",

  "dialogue.story.enderdragon.success/1": "Unbelievable! So, you got the dragon egg or what?",
  "dialogue.story.enderdragon.success/2": "What's this I hear? You went and slayed the legendary dragon, huh? Bet the villagers won't shut up about it for ages.",
  "dialogue.story.enderdragon.fail/1": "Pfft, have you been hit on the head? That ender dragon's a fairy tale.",
  "dialogue.story.enderdragon.fail/2": "Are you pulling my leg? A mere mortal wounding that beast? Madness!",

  "dialogue.story.wither.success/1": "Unbelievable! That Wither's a one-way ticket to mayhem and ruin!",
  "dialogue.story.wither.success/2": "You whipped the Wither? You're pullin' my leg! That's absurd!",
  "dialogue.story.wither.fail/1": "Pull the other one, I wasn't born yesterday.",
  "dialogue.story.wither.fail/2": "Hah, you're hardly a scratch on you – expect me to buy that tale?",

  "dialogue.stay.fail/1": "Hmph, I'd rather wander the wilds than stay put.",
  "dialogue.stay.fail/2": "Appreciate the offer, but I've got a world to see, not a village to sit in!",
  "dialogue.stay.fail/3": "This place ain't bad, but I'm not the type to laze around in one spot.",
  "dialogue.stay.repeat/1": "Didn't you just ask that? Your memory is as short as a baby zombie's temper.",
  "dialogue.stay.repeat/2": "Again with the same question? What am I, a parrot?",
  "dialogue.stay.success/1": "Fine, I'll stick around this dreary place.",
  "dialogue.stay.success/2": "Great, just what I wanted, to linger in this village.",
  "dialogue.stay.no_space/1": "Hmph, what's this? A sardine can? No room to swing a pickaxe here.",
  "dialogue.stay.no_space/2": "I'd ponder settling down, but it looks like every bed's been claimed.",

  "dialogue.hire/1": "Fine, summon me when there's work to do. But remember, I'm only sticking around as long as the coin's good.",
  "dialogue.hire/2": "Yeah, yeah, give a shout when it's time to toil. Just make sure my pockets jingle with emeralds.",
  "dialogue.hire/3": "Okay, I'll lend a hand. But I better see those emeralds shining, or I'm off!",
  "dialogue.no_money/1": "Don't bother, you can't afford me without more emeralds!",
  "dialogue.no_money/2": "What's this, a joke? Scrape together more emeralds, then we'll talk!",
  "dialogue.no_money/3": "Don't insult me! Scrounge up some more emeralds if you actually want my help.",

  "dialogue.main.rock_paper_scissor/1": "Engage in that hand clash game, if you must.",
  "dialogue.rock_paper_scissor/1": "Stone, parchment, shears, now!",
  "dialogue.rock_paper_scissor/2": "Prepare to lose this round, you will!",
  "dialogue.rock_paper_scissor.rock/1": "Pah, rock, obviously.",
  "dialogue.rock_paper_scissor.paper/1": "Pfft, paper, obviously.",
  "dialogue.rock_paper_scissor.scissor/1": "Scissors, okay? Hmph.",
  "dialogue.rock_paper_scissor.loose.rock/1": "Ha! Paper smothers your puny rock. Better luck next time, I guess.",
  "dialogue.rock_paper_scissor.loose.paper/1": "Bah, I'll grudgingly choose scissors, I suppose!",
  "dialogue.rock_paper_scissor.loose.scissor/1": "Bah! Your rock smashes my scissors, you got this round... Humph!",
  "dialogue.rock_paper_scissor.win.rock/1": "Ugh, blasted rock smashes scissor. I'm defeated again.",
  "dialogue.rock_paper_scissor.win.paper/1": "That blasted rock never does me any good!",
  "dialogue.rock_paper_scissor.win.scissor/1": "Hmph, your scissors snipped my paper, enjoy your rare victory.",
